This project is a part of my Autonomous Robotics project. It presents the implementation and test of two high-level controllers in terms of path planning algorithms (Tangent Bug and Rapidly Exploring Random Trees) for controlling a mobile robot in an environment with obstacles. The platform and robot software used in the implementation are TurtleBot and ROS (Robot Operating System) respectively. Furthermore, all the tests are conducted in Stage robot simulator.
